## Ideas for Final Project

### Article 
I found an article titled [Using Data Science to Uncover the Work of Women in Science](https://womenshistory.si.edu/blog/using-data-science-uncover-work-women-science) 
from the Smithsonian American Women's History Museum. I find this interesting because it is an example of having too much historical data to go through and using computers
to help accomplish this. History is generally about dates and certain figures, but it can also use data to get a clearer picture of the time. This article explores how women 
that were doing scientific work didn't always get the recognition they deserved.

### Data Visualization

I always have found population data displayed like this to be fascinating. You get two bits of information, age and gender, in an easy to read graph. I'm interested in graphs 
that take two points of information and relate them to a value.

### Dataset Table

| Dataset        | Description and How Coding Useful         | Link  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Eastern State Penitentiary Admission Book A      | This is a record of admission of around 1100 prisoners that includes name, crime, sentence, race/ethnicity, time in and out, and more. Coding might be useful to determine if prisoners served their full sentence by comparing the time in and out to the sentence. It could also be used to search names to see if a prisoner returned after release. | [Prisoners dataset](https://repository.upenn.edu/entities/dataset/9e9c9a7e-c78d-40ba-9541-148b59806870) |
| The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft      | This dataset is from 1563 - 1736 and contains nearly 4,000 people who were accused of witchcraft in Scotland. It has various information about where they were accused, why, what happened to them, and also other themes related to social and cultural history. Coding might be useful to explore where were common places people were accused and what timespan did those accusations occur for that location. Coding could also explore the dataset based on sex or age and if that played a part in location as well. One could use coding to see how contagious accusing someone of witchcraft was and what were the most common causes of accusation.       |   [Witches dataset](https://witches.hca.ed.ac.uk/) |
| England's Immigrants  | This is a huge database that follows the immigrants to England from 1330 - 1550 with over 64,000 names. This era includes the Hundred Years' War, Black Death and more. Coding could be used to determine the age and ethnicity of immigrants during certain English historical milestones. Coding could search the database based on occupation and/or social status to see what time periods certain classes were immigrating and from where.       |    [Immigrants dataset](https://www.englandsimmigrants.com/) |
| Cline Center Coup D’état  | This dataset looks at various coups attempts that have happened since World War II to 2019. It includes if it was successful or not, what type of people started it and the fate of the deposed leader. Coding could see if successful coup attempts were determined by location or types of people or both. It could also be used to see what time periods have seen the most coups.         |    [Coups D’état dataset](https://databank.illinois.edu/datasets/IDB-9651987) |
